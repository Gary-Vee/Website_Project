            The 1970's seems like decade of true realization of the ideals from the progressive era. The Civil Rights
            act of
            1965 act was well underway, social welfare programs were still in effect and an underground movement that
            started nearly a century prior was seemingly coming to an end with most of its political aspirations
            achieved. Except for one: the ERA (Equal Rights Amendment).

            Well, let's look at the language:
        </p>
        <div class="sections">
            <p>
                Section 1: Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by
                any state on account of sex.
            </p>
            <p>
                Section 2: Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
                article.
            </p>
            <p>
                Section 3: This amendment shall take effect two years after the date of ratification."
            </p>

            For over a century, Women in the workforce have been under minded and undervalued in modern day society.
            Whether that be limiting the work opportunities to very menial roles such as teacher, washer, or desk clerks
            to name a few. Due to conservative idealistic values of how women should "behave" it became almost
            impossible for the latter to set out and make what they can with their own destiny.According to an article
            posted on March 1st, 2023, by Carolina Aragao, women in past 20 years "earned an average of 82% of what men
            earned,". Significantly making that old statement of "women earning 0.75 cents to the man's Doller" ring
            ever truer. Even if the income in this this article says slightly otherwise.
