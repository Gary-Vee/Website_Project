        According to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/earnings.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics data</a> in 2020, women’s
        annual earnings were 82.3% of men’s, and the gap is even wider for many women of color. Though women only made 57
        cents per dollar earned by men in 1973 when this <a

      <p>
        The wage gap is even greater for many women. To earn what white, non-Hispanic men earned in 2020, Asian American
        and Pacific Islander women had to work until March 9. Mothers won’t catch up until June 4 (compared with fathers,
        on average). <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty.html"> For many women of color, Equal Pay Day
          falls later and later into the year.</a> For Black women it is not until Aug. 3. For Native American women it is
        not until Sept. 8. Lastly, for Latinas, Equal Pay Day is more than 9 months into the year on Oct. 21.

        Unfortunately, the pandemic stalled gains made toward closing the pay gap, and layoffs and a lack of child care
        have forced many women out of the workforce entirely. In February 2021, women’s labor force participation rate was
        55.8% the same rate as April 1987. And women of color and those working in low-wage occupations <a

          impacted.</a>
