  <p class="info">
    The gender pay gap in New York City has been a persistent issue throughout history, with women often
    earning less than men for the same work. The pay gap has its roots in the discrimination and inequality
    that women have faced in the workplace, and despite efforts to close the gap, it still exists today.
    In the early 20th century, women began to enter the workforce in larger numbers, but they were often
    relegated to low-paying jobs such as domestic work and factory labor. During World War II, women took
    on jobs in factories and other traditionally male-dominated industries while men were fighting overseas,
    but when the war ended, women were pushed out of these jobs and back into lower-paying positions.
    In the 1960s and 1970s, the feminist movement brought attention to the issue of pay inequality, and
    legislation such as the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 helped to reduce the gap somewhat.</p>

   <p class="info"> However, women continued to earn less than men, and the gap widened again in the 1980s
    and 1990s as the economy shifted towards service and technology jobs.
    Today, the gender pay gap in New York City is still significant, with women earning only 89 cents for
    every dollar earned by men. This gap is even wider for women of color, with Black and Latina women
    earning only 63 and 54 cents, respectively, for every dollar earned by white, non-Hispanic men.
    Despite ongoing efforts to close the gap, such as the recent passage of the New York City Salary History
    Ban in 2017, progress has been slow. The pandemic has also had a significant impact on women in the
    workforce, with many losing their jobs or being forced to take on lower-paying part-time work to
    accommodate childcare and other responsibilities.
    In conclusion, the gender pay gap in New York City has a long and complex history, and although
    progress has been made, there is still much work to be done to achieve true equality in the workplace. It
    is crucial that policies and initiatives are implemented to address the systemic issues that perpetuate
    the pay gap and ensure that all workers are paid fairly and equally.

  <p class="info">Women in New York, as in the nation overall, have made substantial progress toward economic equality
    over the last several decades but still lag behind men in important ways. Women earn less than their male
    counterparts, are more likely to live in poverty, and are less likely to own businesses. Even in areas where womenâ€™s
    status has advanced, there is room for improvement </p>

  <p class="info">The Commission on Gender Equity's Strategic Plan Advancing Gender Equity in New York City announces
    the Commission's goals and strategies to advance gender equity in New York City through the remainder of the de
    Blasio administration. The plan also identifies lead initiatives which will be the initial programmatic focus of
    each strategy.

    The plan also introduces the City's first-ever Gender Equity Inter-Agency Partnership, aimed at helping develop an
    integrated and sustainable approach to achieving gender equity in NYC. The group is comprised of senior-level agency
